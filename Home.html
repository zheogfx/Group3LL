            <p> The region greatly affected by Typhoon Rai in the Philippines includes parts of <b> Caraga, Eastern Visayas, Central<br> Visayas, and Northern Mindanao.</b> This is because, geographically, these areas are located in the <b>eastern and central <br>parts of the country, facing the Pacific Ocean</b>, making them <b>vulnerable</b> to typhoons. That's why when the typhoon <br>comes, most of their diverse industries are also affected, such as <b> agriculture, fishing and manufacturing. </b>
